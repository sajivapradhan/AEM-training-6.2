The AEM Project Archetype provides an excellent starting point when developing our own projects.  The sample code demonstrates many of the features (such as Sightly and Sling Models) introduced in AEM 6.0.  It is worth review the code and configurations.  For more information about archetype see the Git Hub page [https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-project-archetype] (https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-project-archetype).
