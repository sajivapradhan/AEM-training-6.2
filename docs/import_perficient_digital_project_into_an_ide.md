## Import into IntelliJ

1. If no project is currently open in IntelliJ IDEA, click Import Project on the Welcome screen. Otherwise, select File | New | Project from Existing Sources.

2. In the dialog that opens, select the directory that contains the project to be imported, or a file that contains an appropriate project description. Click OK.

3. On the first page of the Import Project wizard, select Maven, and click Next. (This page is not shown if IntelliJ IDEA has guessed what you are importing.)

4. On the next page of the wizard, specify the project root directory. Define your import preferences, if they differ from those specified in the Maven Integration dialog. Click Environment settings to configure Maven environment settings.
Click Next.

5. On the next page of the wizard, select the desired profiles, and click Next.

6. On the next page of the wizard, select the projects to be imported. Note that IntelliJ IDEA detects Maven projects by scanning the specified root. Click Next.

7. On the next page of the wizard, select the project's SDK. Click Next.

8. On the next page of the wizard, specify the new project name and location of the project files. Click Finish.
